When a service crashes, it doesn't just restart it - it checks for port conflicts, validates configs, tests the database, and then sends you a detailed email explaining what broke and how it was fixed.\n\nv1.0 includes:\n- Universal service healing (any systemd service)\n- JavaScript/CSS error monitoring for web apps\n- External monitoring via Healthchecks.io for 100% coverage\n- Complete test suite\n- Production-ready documentation\n\nIt's MIT licensed and built to be extended.

Not just \"restart the service\" - it diagnoses root cause, applies the appropriate fix, and sends you a detailed report.\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Service crashes\n2. ANSAI detects failure (seconds)\n3. Checks: Port conflict? Config valid? Database locked? Environment OK?\n4. Applies appropriate fix\n5. Restarts service\n6.

A: ANSAI sends an email alert with diagnostic info. It won't infinite-loop - there's cooldown logic. You still have your existing monitoring.</p> <p>Q: Does it work with [insert service]? A: Any systemd service. Flask, Node.js, databases, web servers, custom apps - if systemd manages it, ANSAI can heal it.</p> <p>Q: What about Kubernetes? A: Currently focused on systemd-based systems. K8s has built-in self-healing. ANSAI fills the gap for VMs, bare metal, and single-host deployments.</p> <p>Q: How much overhead? A: Minimal. Health checks run only on failure. No constant polling. Resource usage is negligible.</p> <p>Q: Can I customize healing strategies? A: Absolutely. It's Ansible - just add your own tasks. We provide templates and patterns.</p> <p>Q: Does it replace my monitoring? A: No, it complements it. Your monitoring detects issues. ANSAI fixes them. Keep both.</p> <p>Q: What about security? A: Runs as systemd services with limited permissions. Email credentials in encrypted Ansible vault. Open source - audit the code.</p> <p>Q: How do I contribute? A: GitHub issues and discussions. We're community-driven.
