# Build Your Automation. Your Way.

<div class="hero-section" markdown>

## Infrastructure Building Blocks for Creative DevOps

**Think Lego.** **Think Minecraft.** **Think Infinite Possibilities.**

ANSAI gives you automation building blocks. You decide what to create.

Not a product. **A platform.**

## 🎯 The ANSAI Difference

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🧱 **Building Blocks, Not Solutions**
    
    We don't tell you what to build. We give you modular components - healing, monitoring, orchestration, integrations. **You combine them your way.**

-   ### 🎨 **Infinite Creativity**
    
    No prescribed paths. No "right way." Build ChatOps, deployment pipelines, compliance-as-code, or something we never imagined. **Your infrastructure. Your rules.**

-   ### 🤝 **Community Creations**
    
    Share what you build. Learn from others. The best patterns become official examples. **We all get better together.**

-   ### 🔧 **Ansible-Native**
    
    Use the tools you know. No proprietary languages. No vendor lock-in. **If you know Ansible, you're 80% there.**

## 💡 What Are People Building?

!!! success "ChatOps from Anywhere"
    *"Combined ANSAI's healing blocks with Slack. Now my team restarts services from their phones. Built in 2 hours."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Service healing + notifications  

!!! success "Automated Cost Optimization"
    *"Built a workflow that scales down dev environments at night, back up in morning. Saved 40% on AWS."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Orchestration + scheduling + AWS APIs  

!!! success "Full Deployment Pipeline"
    *"Started with self-healing, now have automated rollbacks, DB migrations, compliance checks. It's our entire infrastructure."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Multiple patterns combined

## 🧱 Core Building Blocks (Phase 1)

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🛡️ **Service Healing Framework**
    
    Intelligent service monitoring and auto-remediation. Detects failures, diagnoses root causes (ports, config, database, environment), applies fixes, sends detailed reports.
    
    **Base capabilities:** systemd integration, intelligent diagnostics, email reporting, extensible healing strategies

-   ### 🎯 **Orchestration Engine**
    
    Event-driven workflow automation with dependency resolution, rollback patterns, and systemd hooks.
    
    **Base capabilities:** Multi-step workflows, conditional logic, state management, failure handling

-   ### 💓 **Monitoring Integration**
    
    Flexible monitoring patterns with external service integration (Healthchecks.io included as example).
    
    **Base capabilities:** Health check patterns, alerting framework, dead-man's switch support, custom integrations

-   ### 🔧 **Ansible-Native Patterns**
    
    Standard Ansible roles, playbooks, and patterns. No proprietary tools - just Ansible best practices.
    
    **Base capabilities:** Reusable roles, composable playbooks, inventory patterns, vault integration

## 💡 Example Use Cases (Built with ANSAI)

**Here are some real implementations showing what you can build:**

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🐛 **JavaScript/CSS Error Monitoring**
    
    *Example implementation by creator*  
    Real-time frontend error capture, runtime logging, alerting system for web applications.
    
    **Demonstrates:** Monitoring patterns + alerting framework + custom data collection

-   ### 📧 **Email Alert System**
    
    *Example implementation by creator*  
    Detailed diagnostic emails with healing reports, failure analysis, and recovery steps.
    
    **Demonstrates:** Service healing + notification patterns + report generation

-   ### ❤️ **Healthchecks.io Integration**
    
    *Example implementation by creator*  
    External monitoring with uptime tracking, dead-man's switch, and third-party alerting.
    
    **Demonstrates:** Monitoring integration + external APIs + health reporting

-   ### 🔄 **Multi-Service Orchestration**
    
    *Example implementation by creator*  
    Coordinated healing across multiple services with dependency awareness and rollback capability.
    
    **Demonstrates:** Orchestration engine + service coordination + state management

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Clone the blocks:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thebyrdman-git/ansai.git
cd ansai
```

**2. Pick your blocks:**
```bash
# Review available building blocks
ls orchestrators/ansible/roles/
```

**3. Deploy your creation:**
```bash
cd orchestrators/ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-complete-monitoring.yml
```

**That's it.** Your automation is running. Now customize, extend, and **build something amazing.**
