# AI-Powered Automation. Finally.

<div class="hero-section" markdown>

## Stop Scripting. Start Thinking.

**ANSAI = Ansible + AI**

Your infrastructure makes intelligent decisions. Not just automated—**intelligent.**

Root cause analysis. Predictive failures. Context-aware actions. Cost optimization.

**Without AI, it's just Ansible. With ANSAI, it thinks.**

## 🎯 Why AI-Powered Automation?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🧠 **Intelligent, Not Just Automated**
    
    Traditional automation follows scripts. ANSAI uses AI to analyze, predict, and decide. **Your infrastructure actually thinks.**

-   ### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
    
    Not just "service failed." ANSAI's AI analyzes logs, correlates events, identifies patterns. **Tells you WHY it failed.**

-   ### 📊 **Predictive, Not Reactive**
    
    AI learns your patterns. Predicts failures before they happen. Optimizes costs automatically. **Proactive, not just responsive.**

-   ### 💬 **Natural Language Operations**
    
    "Why is CPU high?" "Optimize my database." "What changed last night?" **Talk to your infrastructure.**

## 🧱 AI-Powered Building Blocks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🛡️ **AI-Powered Service Healing**
    
    Not just restart-on-failure. AI analyzes logs, identifies root causes, correlates events. **Learns what "normal" looks like.**
    
    **AI capabilities:** Root cause analysis, pattern recognition, predictive failure detection, intelligent remediation

-   ### 🎯 **AI Orchestration Engine**
    
    AI makes routing decisions based on cost, performance, and load. Optimizes workflows automatically. **Learns from every execution.**
    
    **AI capabilities:** Cost-aware routing, intelligent fallback, load prediction, workflow optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Install AI Engine (Required):**
```bash
# Install LiteLLM for multi-model LLM access
pip install 'litellm[proxy]'

# Or install Fabric for AI text processing
pipx install fabric-ai
```

**2. Clone ANSAI:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thebyrdman-git/ansai.git
cd ansai
```

**3. Set up your LLM keys:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"  # Or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY
# For local models: install Ollama (no API key needed)
```

**4. Deploy AI-powered automation:**
```bash
cd orchestrators/ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-ai-powered-monitoring.yml
```

**That's it.** Your AI-powered automation is thinking for you.
