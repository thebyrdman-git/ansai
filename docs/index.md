# Build Your Automation. Your Way.

<div class="hero-section" markdown>

## Infrastructure Building Blocks for Creative DevOps

**Think Lego.** **Think Minecraft.** **Think Infinite Possibilities.**

ANSAI gives you automation building blocks. You decide what to create.

Not a product. **A platform.**

## 🎯 The ANSAI Difference

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🧱 **Building Blocks, Not Solutions**
    
    We don't tell you what to build. We give you modular components - healing, monitoring, orchestration, integrations. **You combine them your way.**

-   ### 🎨 **Infinite Creativity**
    
    No prescribed paths. No "right way." Build ChatOps, deployment pipelines, compliance-as-code, or something we never imagined. **Your infrastructure. Your rules.**

-   ### 🤝 **Community Creations**
    
    Share what you build. Learn from others. The best patterns become official examples. **We all get better together.**

-   ### 🔧 **Ansible-Native**
    
    Use the tools you know. No proprietary languages. No vendor lock-in. **If you know Ansible, you're 80% there.**

## 💡 What Are People Building?

!!! success "ChatOps from Anywhere"
    *"Combined ANSAI's healing blocks with Slack. Now my team restarts services from their phones. Built in 2 hours."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Service healing + notifications  

!!! success "Automated Cost Optimization"
    *"Built a workflow that scales down dev environments at night, back up in morning. Saved 40% on AWS."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Orchestration + scheduling + AWS APIs  

!!! success "Full Deployment Pipeline"
    *"Started with self-healing, now have automated rollbacks, DB migrations, compliance checks. It's our entire infrastructure."*  
    **Blocks Used:** Multiple patterns combined

## 🧱 Available Blocks (Phase 1)

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### 🛡️ **Service Healing**
    
    Monitors services, diagnoses failures (ports, config, database, environment), applies intelligent fixes, sends detailed reports.
    
    **What you can build:** Custom healing strategies, auto-scaling, ChatOps commands, multi-environment dashboards

-   ### 🐛 **Error Monitoring**
    
    Captures JavaScript/CSS errors in real-time, logs runtime issues, sends alerts with context.
    
    **What you can build:** Custom dashboards, Slack notifications, automatic rollbacks, A/B test error comparison

-   ### 💓 **External Monitoring**
    
    Integrates with Healthchecks.io for 100% uptime coverage, dead-man's switch alerting.
    
    **What you can build:** Multi-region health checks, custom alerting workflows, SLA monitoring

-   ### 🎯 **Orchestration Patterns**
    
    Event-driven workflows, systemd integration, dependency resolution, rollback patterns.
    
    **What you can build:** Blue-green deployments, multi-region failover, custom deployment strategies
