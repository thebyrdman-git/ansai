Building Self-Healing Infrastructure with ANSAI

Join us for a deep dive into ANSAI (Ansible-Native Self-Healing Automation Infrastructure) - an open-source framework that automatically detects and remediates infrastructure failures.

What you'll learn:
• How self-healing infrastructure reduces on-call burden and improves uptime
• Real-world examples: automatic service recovery, error monitoring, and intelligent diagnostics
• Live demo: Watch ANSAI detect a failure, diagnose the root cause, and fix it automatically
• Architecture patterns: Building resilient systems with Ansible
• Getting started: Deploy your first self-healing service in 10 minutes

Perfect for: DevOps engineers, SREs, sysadmins, and anyone tired of fixing the same issues at 2 AM.
