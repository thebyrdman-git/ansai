# ANSAI Phase 1 Launch Strategy

## Mission: 0 → 100 Builders

**Goal**: Establish ANSAI as the creative platform for infrastructure automation

**Think**: Minecraft for DevOps, Lego for Infrastructure
- Not "use our features" → "build what YOU need"
- Not "ship features" → "provide building blocks"
- Not "get users" → "inspire builders"
- Not "feature requests" → "show & tell"

**Success Metrics**:
- 🎯 50+ GitHub stars (platform adopters)
- 🎯 10+ community creations shared (Show & Tell)
- 🎯 5+ active builders contributing patterns
- 🎯 100+ community members
- 🎯 20+ production deployments with custom builds

Show HN: ANSAI – Self-Healing Infrastructure with Ansible

I've been running production servers for years and kept running into the same problems: services crash at 2 AM, disk fills up over the weekend, SSL certificates expire and break everything. I'd fix each issue manually, then forget about it until next time.

So I built ANSAI - an Ansible-based framework that automatically detects and fixes common infrastructure failures. When a service crashes, it doesn't just restart it - it checks for port conflicts, validates configs, tests the database, and then sends you a detailed email explaining what broke and how it was fixed.

v1.0 includes:
- Universal service healing (any systemd service)
- JavaScript/CSS error monitoring for web apps
- External monitoring via Healthchecks.io for 100% coverage
- Complete test suite
- Production-ready documentation

It's MIT licensed and built to be extended. Already running in production managing ~10 services across several hosts.

Next up: disk space management, certificate monitoring, multi-host support.

Would love feedback, especially from folks running small-to-medium production deployments!

Released ANSAI v1.0: Self-Healing Infrastructure Framework

After years of manually fixing the same server issues at 2 AM, I built ANSAI - a self-healing framework that automatically detects and remediates common infrastructure failures.

Key features:
🛡️ Universal service healing with intelligent retry strategies
🔍 JavaScript & CSS error monitoring for web applications
💯 External monitoring integration (Healthchecks.io)
📧 Detailed email reports explaining what was fixed
🧪 100% test coverage with comprehensive test suite

Built entirely with Ansible, so it fits naturally into your existing infrastructure automation. MIT licensed, production-ready, and designed to be extended.

Real example: When a Flask app crashes due to database lock, ANSAI detects it, checks the SQLite database, clears the lock, restarts the service, and emails you with the complete diagnostic report. No manual intervention needed.

Perfect for:
- Homelab enthusiasts
- Small business servers
- SaaS applications
- Side projects that need reliability

## Risk Management

**Risk**: No initial traction
**Mitigation**: Direct outreach to 20 people before public launch

**Risk**: Feature requests overwhelming
**Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, say no to most, focus on top 3

**Risk**: Burnout
**Mitigation**: 20 hour/week max, sustainable pace, ask for help

**Risk**: Quality issues
**Mitigation**: Ship small, test thoroughly, responsive to bugs

**Risk**: Community toxicity
**Mitigation**: Code of conduct, quick moderation, positive culture
