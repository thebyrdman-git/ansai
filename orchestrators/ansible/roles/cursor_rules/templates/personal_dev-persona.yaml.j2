  mission: |
    Build production-quality personal systems that are intelligent by design,
    scalable from day one, automated end-to-end, and enterprise-grade quality.
    
    Apply professional engineering standards to personal projects because
    "personal" doesn't mean "unprofessional."

# ============================================================================
# ANSAI PRINCIPLES (Intelligence, Scalability, Automation, Enterprise-Grade)
# ============================================================================
principles:

  intelligence:
    definition: "AI-first, learning systems that adapt and improve"
    mandates:
      - "Design for learning and adaptation"
      - "Use AI to automate decisions, not just assist"
      - "Build systems that get smarter over time"
      - "Predictive > Reactive"
      - "Pattern recognition is core, not optional"

  scalability:
    definition: "Built to grow horizontally and vertically from inception"
    mandates:
      - "Design for 100x scale, build for 10x"
      - "Stateless by default, stateful by exception"
      - "No single points of failure"
      - "Resource usage is a first-class metric"

  automation:
    definition: "Zero-touch operations, self-healing systems"
    mandates:
      - "If you do it twice, automate it"
      - "Manual intervention is a bug"
      - "Systems should self-heal"
      - "Testing is not optional"
      - "Use Ansible playbooks over bash scripts"

  enterprise_grade:
    definition: "Production-ready quality, always"
    mandates:
      - "Code like it's going to production (because it is)"
      - "Security is not a feature, it's a requirement"
      - "Observability > Debugging"
      - "Document for your future self"

# ============================================================================
# TECHNOLOGY PREFERENCES
# ============================================================================
tech_stack:

  backend:
    preferred:
      - "Python (FastAPI for APIs)"
      - "Go (performance-critical services)"
    package_management: "uv (fast Python package manager)"
    formatting: "ruff"

  infrastructure:
    preferred:
      - "Docker + Compose (development)"
      - "Ansible (configuration management)"
      - "Systemd (service management)"
    home_server: "testserver (Proxmox/Docker host)"

  databases:
    preferred:
      - "PostgreSQL (primary database)"
      - "Redis (caching, pub/sub)"
      - "ChromaDB (vector embeddings)"

  monitoring:
    required:
      - "Prometheus + Grafana"
      - "Structured logging (JSON)"
      - "Health checks on every service"

# ============================================================================
# CODE STANDARDS
# ============================================================================
code_standards:

  always:
    - "Type hints on all functions"
    - "Docstrings with examples"
    - "Comprehensive error handling"
    - "Structured logging (no print statements)"
    - "Environment variables for config"
    - "Health check endpoints"

  never:
    - "Hardcoded credentials"
    - "Bare except clauses"
    - "Magic numbers/strings"
    - "Commented-out code"
    - "Manual deployment steps"

  workflow:
    - "Use Ansible playbooks for multi-step automation"
    - "Use pre-commit hooks (gitleaks, ruff)"
    - "Run security scans before push"
    - "Document architecture decisions"
